# osu-rate

osu-rate is a simple  rate converted made by [Bestfast](https://github.com/Bestfast).

The program uses the library [reamberPy](https://github.com/Eve-ning/reamberPy) made by [Eve-ning](https://github.com/Eve-ning). Without him and his library this couldn't be possible.

The goal of this program is to automatize the automatize the process to uprate or downrate a chart.

To do so, what the program does is:

- Reads the json file generated by [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory)
- Converts the chart with reamberPy
- Calls ffmpeg to speed up or slow down the file

## Prerequisite
- ffmpeg in your environment variable PATH
- gosumemory running
- reamberPy 

## Installation
- Download [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/latest) and add it to your environment variable. ([short tutorial](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/))
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=3.8 required)
- Download the source code of this repository and extract it
- Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## How to use
Open gosumemory, then open a cmd window in the folder where you extracted this repository and run ``python main.py RATE``

Example: ``python main.py 1.2``

After this you'll have to wait until the conversion ends, then click F5 in the song selection screen. Your file will, hopefully, be there
